Extensible Markup Language (XML)

	- Standard for data representation and exchange.
	
	- Document format similar to HTML.
		- Tags describe content rather than formatting.
	
	- XML has 3 basic components:
		- Tagged elements (nested)
		- Attributes
		- Text
		
	- When designing an application that deals with data, we have to decide if we want to use
	  relational database or store data in XML.
	  
		- Relational Models vs. XML
			Structure of Data: Tables vs. Hierarchical Tree, Graph
			Schema: Fixed in Advance vs Flexible (self-describing and no schema required)
			Queries: Simple, Nice Queries vs. Less so
			Ordering: No ordering vs. Implied
			Implementation: Native vs. Add On
			

			
Q1: You're creating a database to contain information about university records: students, courses, 
	grades, etc. Should you use the relational model or XML?
	
A1: Relational because the relations (table) are all connected. students are related to grades, grades
    are related to courses and students, courses are related to students and grades, etc.


	
Q2: You're creating a database to contain information for a university web site: news, academic 
    announcements, admissions, events, research, etc. Should you use the relational model or XML?
	
A2: XML because these relations don't benefit from a relational model. Research, admissions, events, news,
    announcements, etc. are all their own things.
	
	
	
Q3: You're creating a database to contain information about family trees (ancestry). Should you use the 
    relational model or XML?	
	
A3: Relational would do a better job at keeping track of who is a descendent to who. However, XML is a 
    hierarchical structure so BOTH would do fine.	
	
	
	
Well-Formed XML

	- Adheres to basic structural requirements.
		- Single root element
		- Matched tags, proper nesting
		- Unique attributes within elements
		
	- To test if a document is well-formed and to access the components of the document in the program, we
	  have something called an XML parser.
		- We take XML document and feed it to an XML parser which will check the basic structure of the doc.
		- If doc does not follow the above 3 requirements, parser will display an error. Otherise, we receive
		  parsed XML.
		  
		  
Displaying XML

	- Use rule-based language to translate to HTML
		- CSS
		- Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)
