Create a DTD for a small XML data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments, 
each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers who teach courses. The XML data is 
here: https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/courses-noID.xml 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]> in your DTD. Your DTD should start with 
<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>. 


SOLUTION: 

 <!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>
     <!ATTLIST Department Code CDATA #REQUIRED>
     <!ELEMENT Department (Title, Chair, Course+)>
          <!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
          <!ELEMENT Chair (Professor)>
              <!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
          <!ATTLIST Course Number CDATA #REQUIRED Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
          <!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?, Instructors, Prerequisites?)>
              <!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA)>
              <!ELEMENT Instructors (Lecturer | Professor)*>
                   <!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
                        <!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
                        <!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
                        <!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>
              <!ELEMENT Prerequisites (Prereq+)>
                  <!ELEMENT Prereq (#PCDATA)>
              
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
In this question, you are to create a DTD for a different version of the data set drawn from the Stanford course 
catalog. This version encodes the data using ID and IDREF(S) attributes. The XML data is here:
https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/courses-ID.xml

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]> in your DTD. Your DTD should start with 
<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>. 			  


SOLUTION: 

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>
    <!ATTLIST Department Code CDATA #REQUIRED Chair IDREF #REQUIRED>
    <!ELEMENT Department (Title, Course+, (Lecturer | Professor)*)>
        <!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
        <!ATTLIST Course Number ID #REQUIRED Prerequisites CDATA #IMPLIED Instructors CDATA #REQUIRED Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
        <!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?)>
            <!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA | Courseref)*>
            <!ELEMENT Courseref EMPTY>
            <!ATTLIST Courseref Number IDREF #REQUIRED>
        <!ATTLIST Professor InstrID ID #REQUIRED>
        <!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
            <!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
            <!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
            <!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>
        <!ATTLIST Lecturer InstrID ID #REQUIRED>
        <!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
		
		
		

		

In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. This data is adapted 
from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, and was originally compiled by the 
Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, population, and area 
(in sq. km). Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) 
and/or cities (with names and populations). The XML data is here: 
https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/countries.xml

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE countries [...]> in your DTD. Your DTD should start with 
<!ELEMENT countries (country*)>. 


SOLUTION:

<!ELEMENT countries (country*)>
    <!ATTLIST country name CDATA #REQUIRED population CDATA #REQUIRED area CDATA #REQUIRED>
    <!ELEMENT country (city | language)*>
        <!ELEMENT city (name, population)>
            <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
            <!ELEMENT population (#PCDATA)>
        <!ATTLIST language percentage CDATA #REQUIRED>
        <!ELEMENT language (#PCDATA)>
