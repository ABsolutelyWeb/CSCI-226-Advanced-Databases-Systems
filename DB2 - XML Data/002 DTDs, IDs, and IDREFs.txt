What is "Valid" XML?

	- Adheres to basic structural requirements.
		- Adheres to content-specific specification.
			- Document Type Descriptor (DTD)
			- XML Schema (XSD)
			
		What happens with well-formed XML docs:
		- An XML document is sent to the XML parser which will decide if the document
		  is either not well-formed or it is well-formed and output parsed XML.
		  
		What happens with valid XML?
		- XML document undergoes validation by the XML parser. Additional input in the
		  process is either a DTD or an XSD. One of these is fed to the parser along with
		  the doc.
		
		- Parser can say document is not well-formed if it doesn't meet basic structural
		  requirements.
		  
			- It can also say doc is not valid AKA structure of the doc does not match 
			  content-specific specification.
			  

Document Type Descriptor (DTD)

	- Grammar-like language for specifying elements, attributes, nesting, ordering, # of
	  occurrences.
	- Also special attribute types ID and IDREF(S)
	
	
DTD / XSD vs. None (Well-Formed)

	PROS
		- Programs are simpler due to not needing much error checking on data.
		- Programs know that before the data reaches them, it's been run through
		  a validator and it does satisfy a particular structure.
		- Documentation
		
	CONS (Benefits of not using DTD)
		- Flexibility / ease of change in how data is formatted.
		- Cleaner / not having to deal with messiness.
