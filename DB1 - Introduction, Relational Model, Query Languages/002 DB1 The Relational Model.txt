The Relational Model:

1. Basic Facts About the Relational Model

		- More than 35 years old.
		- Foundation of DBMS.
		- Underlies most, if not all, commercial database systems.
		- Simple model.
		
		
2. What is a database?

		- A database is a set of named relations or tables (each of which has a name).
		- Each table has a set of name attributes or columns.
		- Each tuple or row has a value for each attribute.
		- Each attribute has a type like INT, VARCHAR, etc.
			- A special type is NULL for "unknown" or "undefined" values.
		
		- In an example database, say we have two tables. One table is for students
		  while the other table is for colleges. 
		- The fields in the student table are ID, name, GPA, and photo. The table would
		  be created like
		  
					CREATE TABLE students (
						id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
						name VARCHAR(100),
						gpa DECIMAL(2,1),
						photo varchar(65535)
					);
					
		- The fields in the college table are name, state, enrollment. The table would
		  be created like:
		  
					CREATE TABLE colleges (
						name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
						state VARCHAR(2),
						enrollment INT
					);
					
		- The data is stored in the rows of these tables.
		- Assume we have in the students table a student named Amy with ID 123 along with 
		  a 3.9 GPA and a happy face photo.
		- Assume we have in the colleges table a college named Stanford from CA with 10k enrollment.
		  with a 3.9 GPA and a happy face photo.
		
		- SCHEMA: Structural description of relations in database.
		- INSTANCE: Actual contents at given point in time.
		- KEY: Attribute of a table whose value is unique. Often used as an identifier or a way to link
		       various tables together.
